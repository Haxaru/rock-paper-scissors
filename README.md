# rock-paper-scissors

I created a rock paper scissors game without a UI as of 7.13.23

To play the game, type your choices into the prompt, then right click and inspect the console. There, you will see the results of the game.

Refresh to play again.

A big thanks to the people on Discord (The Odin Project server) for guiding me in the right direction when I was unsure of what to do.

I hope you enjoy this little game I created! :)

An update:

I was finally able to add a very simple ui to my rock paper scissors game. The thing I struggled with most was adding the event listener to the buttons and making them represent the player selection. After that, the rest of the project was finished easily.

Update pt.3:

I added an incredibly simple ui. I didn't struggle with too much but I am happy I was able to dabble in css using flexbox and practice simple styling. :)
